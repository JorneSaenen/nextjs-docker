### Notes

###### Get Docker Desktop: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

###### Don't forget to change the .env file, remove the .example extension

###### Change passwords, usernames, db names, etc. in the docker-compose.yml file

###### The folder db is used to store the database data, so it won't be lost when the container is stopped

###### There is a dump.sql file to get up and running quickly

###### More info will be added later.
